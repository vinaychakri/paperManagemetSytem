# Exam-Paper-mangement-Sytem

Prohect Description 

# The aim of the project is to develop a secure question paper management system for lectures. For every module, an examination paper goes to the verification pattern, which involves lectures to interact with each other and come to a decision. Following that, it should be approved by the examination officer. We are developing an application to simplify the process. The web app uses react as the frontend, Node as the backend, and MongoDB as the database. The users are the lecturer, who is the initiator of the question paper. Examination officer, who finalizes it, and an admin, who keeps track of everything.
